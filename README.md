### Challenge Analysis
#### Problem from Module
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he feels there is one piece of information missing: seasonal data. Heâ€™s asked you to gather data on the seasons of Oahu and determine whether the seasons could affect the surf and ice cream shop business. Specifically, are there certain times of the year when business might be slower, or the type of customer could be different?\

The purpose of the challenge was to identify differences in weather data for the month of June and December. The first #obstecale was having to use different years. The data didn't allow to pull both from 2017, do to the data not being a full year, therefore I had to use 2016 data for December.\
At first glance using standard deviation# the data of the two months seems rather similar with the month of December receiving# slighty more precipitation#.\
Viewing the tempurature data shows a similar slight deviation from the two months, with June's temp. hovering around the upper 70's. Decemeber's sticks to the lower 70's to upper 60's.\
Using this data it is in my opinion that the seasonal weather wouldn't be an issue for business
