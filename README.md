### Challenge Analysis

The purpose of the challenge was to identify differences in weather data for the month of June and December. The first #obstecale was having to use different years. The data didn't allow to pull both from 2017, do to the data not being a full year, therefore I had to use 2016 data for December.\
At first glance using standard deviation# the data of the two months seems rather similar, however using a plot for the precipitation we can see that the data is almost opposite of each other.
